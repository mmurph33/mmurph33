# Hi There! 👋 I'm Matt Murphy

## 📚 Studying Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon
Navigating through Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, I'm simultaneously exploring the exciting realm of Computer Science.

## 💡 Passionate About Coding
My spare time is dedicated to coding projects, pushing my skills and understanding to new levels. I'm particularly proud of my current project – a basketball game in Python – which marks my first major venture into software development.

## 🏀 Team Player On and Off the Court
As a member of CMU's basketball team, I value the importance of teamwork and strategy, lessons I apply in my collaborative projects.

## 🌟 Taking Coding to the Next Level
I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to elevate my coding skills. Whether it's complex algorithms or innovative project ideas, I'm keen on tackling challenges that sharpen my abilities.

## 🤝 Open for Collaboration
I'm interested in collaborating on projects or receiving feedback on my repositories. If you have project ideas or constructive insights, feel free to reach out at [mmmurphy3@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:myemail@example.com).
